# Student Mark Analysis

This project analyzes student performance based on their marks in various subjects. The system reads mark data, processes it to calculate averages, identify trends, and generate useful visualizations. It provides insights into the performance of individual students and helps educators or analysts evaluate class performance.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import student marks data from CSV files.
- **Data Processing**: 
  - Calculate average marks for each student.
  - Calculate the class average for each subject.
  - Identify top-performing students and underperformers.
  - Highlight subject-wise performance.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
  - Performance trends over time.
  - Comparison of individual students' performance.
- **Reports**:
  - Generate summary reports of student performance.
  - Export analysis to CSV or PDF formats.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical analysis and calculations.
  - **Jupyter Notebooks** (optional): For interactive analysis and visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/student-mark-analysis.git
   cd student-mark-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: The marks data should be in CSV format. The required columns are:
   - `Student Name`: Name of the student.
   - `Subject`: Subject for which the mark is being recorded.
   - `Marks`: Marks obtained by the student in the subject.

2. **Running the Analysis**:
   - After setting up, you can run the analysis via a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
   - If using a script, execute:
     ```bash
     python analysis.py
     ```
   - If using Jupyter Notebook, open the `analysis.ipynb` file:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
     ```

3. **Exporting Reports**: Results and charts will be generated automatically. You can export them to CSV or PDF formats for further review or presentation.

## Example Output

- A bar chart showing the marks distribution for each student across subjects.
- A pie chart visualizing the percentage of students who scored above/below average.
- A detailed summary report with average scores, performance rankings, and individual student data.
